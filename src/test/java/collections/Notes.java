Java Collection framework is a set of classes and interfaces that implement commonly reusable collection data structures.
Collection framework allows us to manipulate and store group of objects. Because in collection framework we cannot use primitive data types, we can use only objects.
Collection interfaces and classes are present in java.util package

ArrayList:
ArrayList is used to store group of objects/data.
In array size was fixed and similar type of data had to be saved[int, string]. We can overcome the disadvantage of array using ArrayList.
ArrayList is dynamic array[ArrayList internally uses an array - it can grow and shrink automatically]
ArrayList uses index to store elements
ArrayList allows duplicate elements
ArrayList maintains insertion order

add()	 						- is used to add elements
add(index, element) 			- is used to add data at a particular index
addAll(Collection c) 			- is used to add the data of one array list to another array list 
addAll(index, Collection c)		- is used to add another list at a particular index
removeAll(Collection c) 		- is used to remove matching data present in list2 from list1
remove(index)					- is used to remove data based on index
retainAll(Collection c)         - is used to retain the data that matches with list2 in list1
size()							- gives size of array list / no:of elements present in array list
get(index)						- returns data present at a particular index
contains(element)				- returns boolean value based on if the element is present/not in array list
containsAll(Collection c)		- if all the data is present in list1, then it returns true
